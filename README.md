# SSO Implementation with JWT

This project demonstrates a Single Sign-On (SSO) implementation using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in multiple programming languages. It provides four endpoints for user authentication and management, along with an authentication middleware to validate JWT tokens.

## Features

- User registration endpoint (POST /auth/user) for creating new user accounts.
- User authentication endpoint (POST /auth/login) for logging in and generating JWT tokens.
- Password reset endpoint (POST /auth/forgot) for initiating the password reset process.
- User profile endpoint (GET /user) for retrieving user details after authentication.
- Authentication middleware to validate JWT tokens on protected endpoints.
